Changelog
---------





Build 3.0.2
- Recipes made properly, so they are available even when certain blocks aren't (railcraft tank for example, or if you disable plates) - fixes NEI crash with recipe using nonexistant block.
- Hand signals, two variants, dispatch and stop one. Probably most of world is not using them already, but in certain railroad-centered countries those were used extensively. Maybe in future will add flag/light variants.
-Train Dispatcher Cap, red variant of existing one. Also used extensively in certain countries.
-Added zh_CN.lang, thanks to @TartaricAcid If you also want your language in, feel free to contact me on Github.
